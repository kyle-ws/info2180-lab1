 <h2>Kyle Wilmot-Simpson</h2>
 <p>My name is Kyle Wilmot-Simpson. I am a student of the University of the West Indies. I am currently pursuing a major in Computer Science. One of the courses i have to complete is INFO2180. I like to play video games and watch anime in my free time. I am mostly around a computer for many hours in a day and this peaked my interest in pursuing a career relating to the use of computers. I am interested in Web development because developers earn alot of money. Web development also opens many career opportunities.</p>
